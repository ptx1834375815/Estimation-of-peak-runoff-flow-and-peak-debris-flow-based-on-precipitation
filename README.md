Estimation of peak runoff flow and peak debris flow based on precipitation
This encompasses some programs developed for simulating rainfall-runoff processes. It begins with the retrieval and transformation of GPM data into a format readable by HECHMS, followed by the utilization of HECHMS for rainfall-runoff simulations. Additionally, a regional inference formula for rainfall-runoff simulations is provided. By modifying input parameters in a CSV file and executing 'rainfall-runoff.py,' peak runoff flow for each hour can be obtained. This approach is highly regionalized and based on precipitation-runoff monitoring data from Sichuan, China. The formulation of the inference formula is derived from a PDF document.
